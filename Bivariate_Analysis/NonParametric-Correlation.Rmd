## Nonparametric Correlations

The following are three commonly used **nonparametric correlation coefficients**: **Spearman's rho (R)**, **Kendall's tau**, and the **Gamma coefficient**. These are useful when assumptions required for Pearson correlation (such as interval-level measurement or normality) are violated.

**Note:** The chi-square statistic from two-way tables can also measure the association between variables measured on a nominal scale—something these correlation coefficients do not handle directly.

### Spearman's Rho (ρ)

- Developed for variables measured on at least an **ordinal scale**.
- Computed using the **ranked** values of variables.
- Interpreted like Pearson's correlation — measures the **proportion of variability accounted for**, but in rank form.
- Assumes a **monotonic relationship** (as one variable increases, so does the other, though not necessarily linearly).

### Kendall's Tau (τ)

- Also based on **ranks** and applicable to **ordinal data**.
- Statistically equivalent in power to Spearman's rho, but calculated differently.
- **Interpretation:** Represents the **difference between the probability** that data are in the same order versus different orders.
- Unlike Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau is often interpreted as a **measure of concordance probability**.

**Note:** Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are not numerically identical. Their relationship can be summarized (loosely) as:

```
-1 ≤ 3 * τ - 2 * ρ ≤ 1
```

### Gamma Coefficient

- Best used when **tied observations are frequent** in the data.
- Like Kendall’s tau, Gamma is interpreted as a **difference in concordance probabilities**, but **adjusts for ties**.
- Computed as:

\[
\text{Gamma} = \frac{P - Q}{P + Q}
\]

Where:
- *P* = number of concordant pairs  
- *Q* = number of discordant pairs

Gamma is **more sensitive** than Kendall’s tau in the presence of tied ranks.
