## Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test

### Overview
The **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** is a non-parametric test used to determine whether a sample comes from a specified continuous distribution.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The data follow a specified distribution  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The data do *not* follow the specified distribution

### Test Statistic  
The K-S statistic measures the maximum difference between the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the sample and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the reference distribution:

$$ D = \sup_x |F_n(x) - F(x)| $$

Where:
- \( F_n(x) \) is the ECDF of the sample  
- \( F(x) \) is the fully specified theoretical CDF (must be continuous)

> *Note:* The test requires a fully specified distribution—meaning all parameters (e.g., location, scale) must be known in advance, not estimated from the data.

### Characteristics and Limitations

#### Advantages
- The K-S test is **distribution-free** under the null hypothesis: the distribution of the test statistic does not depend on the form of the tested distribution.
- It is an **exact test**, unlike the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, which requires large samples for validity.

#### Limitations
1. Only applicable to **continuous distributions**.  
2. More sensitive at the **center** of the distribution than at the tails.  
3. Requires the distribution to be **fully specified**; if parameters are estimated from the sample, critical values must be adjusted using simulation or alternative methods.

### Related Tests
Because of limitations (2) and (3), many analysts prefer the **Anderson-Darling test** for goodness-of-fit, especially when tail behavior is important. However, Anderson-Darling is only available for a limited set of distributions.

## Summary

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is a non-parametric method used to compare a sample's distribution to a fully specified continuous theoretical distribution. It works by measuring the largest difference between the sample’s empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) and the theoretical cumulative distribution function (CDF). If this difference exceeds a critical value, the test rejects the hypothesis that the data follow the specified distribution. It’s especially useful because it doesn’t rely on the shape of the tested distribution, but it requires the distribution to be completely defined in advance.
