## Bartlett's test for Homogeneity of Variances
 

Equal variances across samples is called homogeneity of variances. Bartlett's test is used to test if multiple samples have equal variances. 

Some statistical tests, such as the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples.  
The Bartlett test can be used to verify that assumption.


* The null hypothesis is that each of the samples have equal variance.
* The alternative hypothesis states that at least one sample has a significantly different variance.
