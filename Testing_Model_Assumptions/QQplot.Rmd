### Graphical Procedures for assessing Normality


*  The normal probability (Q-Q) plot is a very useful tool for determining whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
*  Interpretation is simple. If the points follow the trendline (provided by the second line of <tt>R</tt> code \texttt{qqline}), then the data set can be assumed to be normally distributed.
*  One should expect minor deviations. Numerous major deviations would lead the analyst to conclude that the data set is not normally distributed.
*  The Q-Q plot is best used in conjunction with a formal procedure such as the Shapiro-Wilk test.
