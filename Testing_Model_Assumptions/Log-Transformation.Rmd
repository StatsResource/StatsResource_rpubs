## Mitigating Non-Normality with Logarithmic Transformation

### Overview

Statistical analyses often assume that the data are **normally distributed (Gaussian)**. When this assumption is violated—especially in skewed or heteroscedastic data—transforming the data can help restore normality and justify the use of parametric tests.

### Why Transform Data?

If data **substantially deviate from a normal distribution**, the typical response is to either:
- Use **nonparametric tests**, which require no distributional assumptions, or
- **Transform the data** to better approximate normality.

Among the most common transformations is the **logarithmic transformation**, which can compress high values, reduce right-skewness, and stabilize variance.

### When to Use Log Transformation

Apply a **log transformation** when:
- Data are **positively skewed** (i.e., long tail to the right)
- You observe **heteroscedasticity** (non-constant variance)
- Data span **several orders of magnitude**
- The distribution is **multiplicative** in nature

> ⚠️ Important: Only apply log transformation to positive-valued data. For zero or negative values, consider log(x + c), where *c* is a small constant.

### Normality Tests and Their Sensitivity

- **Small Sample Sizes**:  
  Normality tests lack power to detect non-normality. A non-significant p-value may offer **false confidence**.

- **Large Sample Sizes**:  
  Normality tests become overly sensitive. Even **trivial deviations** can lead to small p-values, suggesting non-normality even when parametric tests are robust enough to proceed.

---

### Practical Considerations

- **Outliers**: A single outlier can cause a dataset to fail a normality test. Consider investigating and potentially removing or adjusting the outlier before transformation.
- **Decision Making**: Choosing between a parametric or nonparametric test is most critical for **small samples**, where statistical power is limited.
- **Beyond Normality Tests**: Instead of relying solely on normality test p-values, consider visual tools such as histograms, Q-Q plots, or residual plots to assess the nature of non-normality.

### Summary

Logarithmic transformation is a valuable tool in the statistical toolbox for correcting non-normality, especially in **right-skewed** data. While normality tests provide guidance, contextual judgment—and visual inspection—are key when deciding whether transformation is necessary and effective.
