## Introduction

The paired *t*-test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a **significant difference between paired measurements**â€”for example, measurements taken *before and after* an intervention. It evaluates whether the **mean of case-wise differences** between paired observations is equal to zero.

---

## Test Statistic

Under the null hypothesis:

- \( H_0: \mu_d = 0 \), meaning no difference between paired values.
- The test statistic (TS) is calculated as:

\[
TS = \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_d}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}
\]

Where:  
- \( \bar{d} \) = sample mean of the differences  
- \( s_d \) = standard deviation of the differences  
- \( n \) = number of pairs

## Worked Example

An automobile manufacturer tested fuel efficiency on 10 cars using standard gasoline **with and without** an additive. Same driver, same tuning. Data collected:

| Car | With Additive | Without Additive | \( d_i \) | \( d_i^2 \) |
|-----|---------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1   | 36.7          | 36.2             | 0.5       | 0.25        |
| 2   | 35.8          | 35.7             | 0.1       | 0.01        |
| 3   | 31.9          | 32.3             | -0.4      | 0.16        |
| 4   | 29.3          | 29.6             | -0.3      | 0.09        |
| 5   | 28.4          | 28.1             | 0.3       | 0.09        |
| 6   | 25.7          | 25.8             | -0.1      | 0.01        |
| 7   | 24.2          | 23.9             | 0.3       | 0.09        |
| 8   | 22.6          | 22.0             | 0.6       | 0.36        |
| 9   | 21.9          | 21.5             | 0.4       | 0.16        |
| 10  | 20.3          | 20.0             | 0.3       | 0.09        |

---

## Example Computation

From another data set with \( n = 14 \):

- \( \bar{d} = 8.21 \)
- \( \mu_d = 0 \)
- \( s_d = 7.90 \)

\[
TS = \frac{8.21 - 0}{\frac{7.90}{\sqrt{14}}} = 3.881
\]

---

## Decision Criteria

- This is a **two-tailed test** at \( \alpha = 0.05 \)
- Degrees of Freedom: \( df = n - 1 = 13 \)
- Critical Value (CV): 2.1603  
- **Decision Rule:** Reject \( H_0 \) if \( |TS| > CV \)

In this example, since \( 3.881 > 2.1603 \), we reject the null hypothesis.

---

## Alternative Approach: *p*-Value

You can also use statistical software (like **R**, **SAS**, or **SPSS**) to compute the *p*-value.

```R
t.test(Before, After, paired = TRUE)
```

**Output:**
```
        Paired t-test

data:  Before and After
t = 3.8881, df = 13, p-value = 0.001868
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not 0
95 percent confidence interval:
  3.650075 12.778496
sample estimates:
mean of the differences
  8.214286
```

Since **p-value < 0.0250**, we reject the null hypothesis.

---

## Confidence Interval Interpretation

- The 95% Confidence Interval for the mean difference is (3.65, 12.78).
- **Since 0 is not within the interval**, this provides further support to **reject \( H_0 \)**.
- We are 95% confident that the true mean difference lies within this range.

---

## Summary of Decision Rule

> **If** \( |TS| > CV \) **then** Reject \( H_0 \)  
> **If** \( |TS| \le CV \) **then** Fail to Reject \( H_0 \)
