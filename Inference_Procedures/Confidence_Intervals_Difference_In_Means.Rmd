## Confidence Intervals: Difference Between Two Means

A **confidence interval for the difference between two means** helps estimate the range where the true difference between population means is likely to lie, based on sample data.

### Assumptions
To construct this interval, we rely on three main assumptions:
- **Equal variances** in both populations (homogeneity of variance).
- **Normal distribution** of both populations.
- **Independent sampling** of all values.

### Standard Error of the Difference
The standard error (SE) quantifies the variability in the difference between sample means:

$$
S.E.(\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) = \sqrt{\frac{s^2_x}{n_x} + \frac{s^2_y}{n_y}}
$$

Where:
- \( s^2_x \), \( s^2_y \): sample variances
- \( n_x \), \( n_y \): sample sizes
- Degrees of freedom: \( n_x + n_y - 2 \)

### Example Calculation

| Group | Sample Size | Mean   | Variance |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| X     | 17          | 5.353  | 2.743    |
| Y     | 17          | 3.882  | 2.985    |

- Point estimate: \( \bar{x} - \bar{y} = 1.4699 \)
- Standard error: \( SE = 0.5805 \)
- Critical value: 1.96 (for 95% confidence)

**Confidence Interval:**
$$
1.4699 \pm (1.96 \times 0.5805) = (0.33212,\ 2.60768)
$$

### Interpretation
There is evidence that the mean of group X is higher than group Y, and the true population difference likely falls between approximately **0.33 and 2.61**.
