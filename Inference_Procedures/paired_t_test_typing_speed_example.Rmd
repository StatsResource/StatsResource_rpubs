# Evaluating the Impact of Preparatory Courses on Exam Performance

Do preparatory courses actually improve performance in standardized tests like the CompTIA exams? One way to explore this is by analyzing test scores from before and after the course.

This guide walks through a simple statistical analysis using a sample of ten students. Weâ€™ll calculate:

1. The difference in scores for each student  
2. The mean of those differences  
3. The standard deviation to understand variability in improvements

## Sample Data

| Student        | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H    | I   | J    |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|------|
| Score Before   | 700 | 840 | 830 | 860 | 840 | 690 | 830 | 1180 | 930 | 1070 |
| Score After    | 720 | 840 | 820 | 900 | 870 | 700 | 800 | 1200 | 950 | 1080 |

## Step 1: Calculate Score Differences

For each student, subtract the "before" score from the "after" score:

\[
d_i = \text{Score After} - \text{Score Before}
\]

| Student | Difference \( d_i \) |
|---------|----------------------|
| A       | 20                   |
| B       | 0                    |
| C       | -10                  |
| D       | 40                   |
| E       | 30                   |
| F       | 10                   |
| G       | -30                  |
| H       | 20                   |
| I       | 20                   |
| J       | 10                   |

## Step 2: Calculate Mean Difference

To find the average improvement:

\[
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{110}{10} = 11
\]

This means the average score improvement is **11 points**.

---

## Step 3: Calculate Standard Deviation

Standard deviation gives a sense of how consistently scores changed.

First, compute the sum of squared differences:

\[
\sum d_i^2 = 20^2 + 0^2 + (-10)^2 + 40^2 + 30^2 + 10^2 + (-30)^2 + 20^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 = 5900
\]

Then use the formula:

\[
s_d = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum d_i^2 - n\bar{d}^2}{n - 1} }
\]

\[
s_d = \sqrt{ \frac{5900 - 10(11)^2}{9} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4690}{9} } \approx \sqrt{521.11} \approx 22.83
\]

---

## Final Thoughts

- The **mean improvement** suggests students benefited from the preparatory course.  
- The **standard deviation of 22.83** shows that the amount of improvement varied.  
- While some students improved a lot, others showed little or no change.

This variability highlights the importance of considering individual learning styles and backgrounds when evaluating the effectiveness of such courses.
