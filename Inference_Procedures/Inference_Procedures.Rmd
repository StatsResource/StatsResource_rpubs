# Inference Procedures

## Key Points

- The two main types of inference procedures are **Hypothesis Tests** and **Confidence Intervals**.
- Hypothesis tests can be conducted in two ways:
  - Compute a test statistic and compare it to critical values.
  - Compute a **p-value** and compare it to the **significance level** (the most common method, and the focus of this course).

-----------------

## Significance Level

The **significance level** (denoted by α) is the criterion used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. Traditionally:

- α = 0.05 (5%) or α = 0.01 (1%)

The lower the α, the stronger the evidence needed to reject the null hypothesis. A result is statistically significant if the p-value is less than or equal to α.

## The p-value

The **p-value** is the probability of obtaining data as extreme as (or more extreme than) what was observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

### Important Clarification

The p-value is *not* the probability that the null hypothesis is true. For example, a p-value of 0.005 means:

> Assuming the null hypothesis is true, there's a 0.5% chance of obtaining data this extreme.

We then reason: either a rare event occurred, or the null hypothesis is false.

## Using p-values to Reject the Null Hypothesis

- The significance level (α) should be chosen before conducting any analysis.
- If **p ≤ α**, reject the null hypothesis.
- If **p > α**, fail to reject the null.

This process is **binary**: the null is either rejected or not—there’s no “in between” in traditional methods. However, many argue that this rigid view oversimplifies uncertainty and that **lower p-values** do support **stronger evidence** against the null.

### Suggested Practice for This Module

- **p < 0.01** → Reject H₀  
- **p > 0.05** → Fail to reject H₀  
- **0.01 ≤ p ≤ 0.05** → Grey area; suggest collecting more data  
- **p > 0.10** → Never reject H₀  

### Asterisks in R Output

Many R outputs use asterisks to indicate significance levels:

```text
p-value < 0.0001   ***
p-value < 0.001     **
p-value < 0.01       *
p-value < 0.1        .
```

## Sample Size Considerations

In classical statistical tables, samples with **n > 30** are considered large, and **Z values** are used. However:

- For **smaller samples**, use **Student's t-distribution**
- Statistical software like R automatically chooses the correct distribution
- As sample size increases, the **t-distribution converges** to the standard normal distribution

Example: For df = 60, the 97.5% t-quantile is **2.003**, not 1.96.

## Commonly Used Inference Procedures

- Hypothesis test for the **mean of a single sample**
- Hypothesis test for the **means of two independent samples**
- Hypothesis test for the **proportion of a single group**
- Hypothesis test for the **proportions of two independent samples**
