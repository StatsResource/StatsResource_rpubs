## Hypothesis Testing: An Overview

**Hypothesis testing** is a critical component of the scientific method, used to evaluate the validity of proposed explanations for observed phenomena.

### What Is a Hypothesis?
- A **hypothesis** is a tentative, testable explanation for an observation.
- It becomes scientifically legitimate when it meets criteria such as:
  - **Testability**: It must be possible to evaluate it through experimentation.
  - **Simplicity**: Preferably straightforward, though not always feasible.
  - **Generality**: Should explain the phenomenon under various conditions.
  - **Consistency**: Must align with established knowledge.

### The Testing Process
- Scientists conduct **experiments** across different conditions to find evidence that supports or refutes the hypothesis.
- If the hypothesis fails consistently, it's revised or replaced and tested again.
- Successful hypotheses that withstand repeated testing may evolve into **scientific theories or laws**, though they are never considered absolutely proven.

### Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- This method involves analyzing **large datasets** to determine whether observed results are statistically significant.
- If results are **unlikely to be due to chance**, the hypothesis gains support.
