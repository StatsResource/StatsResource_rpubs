## Standard Error: A Brief Guide

The **standard error (SE)** quantifies how much variability exists in a sample statistic from one sample to another. It essentially measures the **spread of the sampling distribution**, helping us understand how close our sample estimates are likely to be to the true population values.

### Key Points
- Every point estimate (like the mean, proportion, or difference between means) has a corresponding standard error.
- It’s useful for constructing **confidence intervals** and conducting **hypothesis tests**.

### Formula for the Standard Error of the Mean
- When the population standard deviation \( \sigma \) is known:

  $$
  S.E( \bar{x} ) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

- In practice, \( \sigma \) is usually unknown, so we estimate it using the sample standard deviation \( s \):

  $$
  S.E( \bar{x} ) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

As sample size increases, the standard error gets smaller—indicating more precision in our estimate.
