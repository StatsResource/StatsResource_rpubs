Useful when analyzing **categorical data**, such as in a 2×2 contingency table. Use `chisq.test()` to determine whether two variables (x and y) are **independent**.

Two random variables are considered independent if the distribution of one is not affected by the other. Suppose:

- \( f_{ij} \) is the observed frequency of events in category *i* of x and *j* of y
- \( e_{ij} \) is the expected frequency under the assumption of independence

The Chi-squared test statistic is used to evaluate:

- **H₀ (Null):** x and y are independent  
- Reject H₀ if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05)

To explore other related functions in R, use:

```r
apropos("test")
```

This will list additional testing functions available in your R environment.

### Graphical Procedures for Assessing Normality

These visual tools help diagnose the shape of a data distribution:

- **`qqnorm()`** – Creates a normal quantile-quantile plot  
- **`qqline()`** – Adds a reference line through Q1 and Q3 on a QQ plot  
- **`qqplot()`** – Compares two datasets using a QQ plot  
- **`hist()`** – Constructs a histogram for visualizing distribution shape

### Scatter Plots

A **scatter plot** displays two variables by placing one on the X-axis (predictor) and one on the Y-axis (response). This helps visualize the **relationship** between the variables.

Example: Galileo’s experiment where distance traveled was plotted against drop height.

In R, scatter plots can be created with:

```r
plot(x, y)
```

More advanced plots (with improved aesthetics and customizations) can be explored later in the semester.

### Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient

The **Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient** (r) measures the strength and direction of a **linear relationship** between two variables:

- **Population symbol:** ρ  
- **Sample symbol:** r  

#### Interpretation of r:
- **-1:** Perfect negative linear correlation  
- **0:** No linear correlation  
- **1:** Perfect positive linear correlation  

Note: Pearson's r assumes a linear relationship. If the relationship is non-linear, r may not reflect it accurately.
