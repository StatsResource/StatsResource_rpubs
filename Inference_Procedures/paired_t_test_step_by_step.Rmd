# Paired t-Test: A Step-by-Step Guide

## What Is a Paired t-Test?

A **paired t-test** is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two sets of related observations. It’s especially useful when the **same subjects are measured under two different conditions**.

### Common Use Cases

- Test scores before and after a preparatory course
- Comparing two treatment methods on the same group
- Measurements by different instruments on the same subjects

---

## Test Scenario

**Question:**  
Does taking a preparatory course improve scores on standardized tests like the CompTIA exams?

To answer this, we'll evaluate a sample dataset and compute:

- Case-wise differences
- Mean of these differences
- Standard deviation and standard error
- Perform a hypothesis test

---

## Sample Data

| Subject | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H    | I   | J    |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|------|
| Before  | 700 | 840 | 830 | 860 | 840 | 690 | 830 | 1180 | 930 | 1070 |
| After   | 720 | 840 | 820 | 900 | 870 | 700 | 800 | 1200 | 950 | 1080 |

---

## Step 1: Calculate the Differences

For each subject:

\[
d_i = \text{After} - \text{Before}
\]

| Subject | Difference \( d_i \) |
|---------|----------------------|
| A       | 20                   |
| B       | 0                    |
| C       | -10                  |
| D       | 40                   |
| E       | 30                   |
| F       | 10                   |
| G       | -30                  |
| H       | 20                   |
| I       | 20                   |
| J       | 10                   |

---

## Step 2: Compute Summary Statistics

### Mean of the Differences

\[
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{110}{10} = 11
\]

### Variance and Standard Deviation

Sample variance:

\[
s_d^2 = \frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n - 1}
\]

Alternatively, use:

\[
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum d_i^2 - n\bar{d}^2}{n - 1}}
\]

From the data:

\[
\sum d_i^2 = 5900,\quad \bar{d} = 11,\quad n = 10
\]

\[
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{5900 - 10(11^2)}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{4690}{9}} \approx 22.83
\]

---

## Step 3: Hypothesis Test

**Null Hypothesis:**  
\( H_0: \mu_d = 0 \) (no difference)

**Alternative Hypothesis:**  
\( H_1: \mu_d \ne 0 \) (a significant difference exists)

Use the test statistic:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{11}{22.83 / \sqrt{10}} \approx 1.52
\]

Compare the computed t-statistic to the critical value from a t-distribution with \( n - 1 = 9 \) degrees of freedom at your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05).

---

## Conclusion

- The **mean improvement** is 11 points.
- The **standard deviation** shows a spread of ±22.83.
- The **t-test** assesses whether this improvement is statistically significant.
