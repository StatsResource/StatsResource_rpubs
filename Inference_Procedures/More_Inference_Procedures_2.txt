\subsection{Transforming the Data}

Sometimes when we get non-normal data, we can change the scale of our data i.e. transform it to get a normal distribution. 
One transformation that often works for positively skewed data is the natural logarithm (ln) transformation.

In such a case, we work with the natural logarithms of the data set, rather than the data itself.
\subsection{Outliers}
Another reason that the data may not be normally distributed is the presence of an outlier. 
We shall look at formal tests for outliers (such as the Grubb's test) next week. Recall that boxplots can be used to detect potential outliers.

\section{Single Sample Inference Procedures}

While analyzing a (single) sample of data values, we will often want to answer several questions:

* What is the mean value?  (i.e. of 100 roles of a die)
* Is the mean value significantly different from some pre-supposed value?
(i.e. Hypothesis testing ; is the observed mean reasonably close to our expected value)
* What is the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the mean value? (i.e. Confidence interval for the estimates)
We refer to the methods used to answer these questions as \textbf{\emph{inference procedures}}.
