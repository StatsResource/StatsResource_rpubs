\section{Testing The Assumption of Normality}
For example, a fundamental assumption of linear models (i.e. regression models) is that the residuals (differences between observed and predicted value) are normally distributed with mean zero.


The null hypothesis of both the `Anderson-Darling' and `Shapiro-Wilk' tests is that the population is normally distributed, and the alternative hypothesis is that the data is not normally distributed.

For both tests, the null and alternative hypothesis are :\\
\qquad $H_0 : $ The data set is normally distributed.\\
\qquad $H_1 : $ The data set is \textbf{not} normally distributed.\\

\subsection{Anderson-Darling Test}
To implement the Anderson-Darling Test for Normality, one must first install the \textbf{\emph{nortest}} package.


<pre><code>
library(nortest)
#Generate 100 normally distributed random numbers
NormDat = rnorm(100)
ad.test(NormDat)
</code></pre>

\subsection{Shapiro-Wilk Test}
The Shapiro-Wilk test is directly implementable, without loading any additional packages.


<pre><code>
#Generate 100 normally distributed random numbers

NormDat = rnorm(100)

shapiro.test(NormDat)
</code></pre>

Sample output, using the randomly generated \texttt{NormDat} data set, is as follows:
<pre><code>
> shapiro.test(NormDat)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  NormDat
W = 0.9864, p-value = 0.4003
</code></pre>
Here, the p-value is well above the 0.05 threshold. Hence we \textbf{fail to reject} the null hypothesis, and may proceed to treat the \texttt{NormDat} data set as normally distributed.
\subsection{Graphical Procedures for Assessing Normality}
There are two useful graphical methods for determining whether a data set was normally distributed. The first is the histogram, which we have seen previously. If the histogram is reasonably bell-shaped, then the data can be assumed to be normally distributed. The relevant R command is \texttt{\textbf{hist()}}.


The second is the \textbf{\emph{quantile-quantile plot}} (or QQ-plot).
For assessing normality, we implement a qq-plot  using the \texttt{\textbf{qqnorm()}} function.

Additionally the command \texttt{\textbf{qqline()}} function adds a trendline to a normal quantile-quantile plot. If the data is normally distributed, then the points on the plot follow the trendline.


<pre><code>
#Generate 100 normally distributed random numbers

NormDat = rnorm(100)

qqnorm(NormDat)
qqline(NormDat)
</code></pre>

\subsection{Transforming the Data}

Sometimes when we get non-normal data, we can change the scale of our data i.e. transform it to get a normal distribution. One transformation that often works for positively skewed data is the natural logarithm (ln) transformation.

In such a case, we work with the natural logarithms of the data set, rather than the data itself.
\subsection{Outliers}
Another reason that the data may not be normally distributed is the presence of an outlier. We shall look at formal tests for outliers (such as the Grubb's test) next week. Recall that boxplots can be used to detect potential outliers.

\section{Single Sample Inference Procedures}

While analyzing a (single) sample of data values, we will often want to answer several questions:

* What is the mean value?  (i.e. of 100 roles of a die)
* Is the mean value significantly different from some pre-supposed value?
(i.e. Hypothesis testing ; is the observed mean reasonably close to our expected value)
* What is the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the mean value? (i.e. Confidence interval for the estimates)
We refer to the methods used to answer these questions as \textbf{\emph{inference procedures}}.
