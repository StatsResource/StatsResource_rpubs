## Equality of Variances: F-Test Tutorial

When comparing two datasets, it’s important to determine if they have the **same variance**. This is where the **F-test** comes in handy.

### Hypotheses

The F-test evaluates the following hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Variances are equal  
  $$\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$$
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** Variances are not equal  
  $$\sigma^2_1 \ne \sigma^2_2$$

Alternatively, the test evaluates the **ratio** of variances:

- **H₀:**  
  $$\frac{\sigma^2_1}{\sigma^2_2} = 1$$
- **Hₐ:**  
  $$\frac{\sigma^2_1}{\sigma^2_2} \ne 1$$

A ratio of 1 means the variances are equal.

### Performing the Test in R

You can use the `var.test()` function in R to run the F-test:

```r
var.test(x, y)
```

Just like `t.test()`, you can customize parameters such as the confidence level.

### Example Output

```r
> var.test(x, y)

        F test to compare two variances

data:  x and y
F = 1.7849, num df = 99, denom df = 99, p-value = 0.004299
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 1.200948 2.652763
sample estimates:
ratio of variances
          1.784889
```

### Interpretation

- **F Value:** 1.78 — This is the calculated ratio of sample variances.
- **Degrees of Freedom (df):** 99 for each group.
- **P-value:** 0.0043 — Since this is less than 0.05, you’d typically reject the null hypothesis.
- **Conclusion:** There's significant evidence that the variances are not equal.
