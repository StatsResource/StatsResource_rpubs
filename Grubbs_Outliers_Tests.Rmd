## Grubbs' Outlier Test

**Grubbs' Test** is a statistical test used to detect outliers in a univariate dataset. While it is widely used, its practicality decreases when multiple outliers are suspected. In such cases, visual tools like boxplots based on **Tukeyâ€™s fences** can offer simpler diagnostic alternatives.

### Variants of Grubbs' Test

Grubbs' test includes three common variants, each designed for different outlier detection scenarios:

---

### 1. Single Outlier Detection (One-Sided Grubbs' Test)

- **Purpose**: To test if there is a single statistical outlier in the dataset.
- **Statistic**:
  
  \[
  G = \frac{|\text{Outlier} - \bar{x}|}{s}
  \]
  where \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean and \( s \) is the sample standard deviation.
  
- The test compares the computed \( G \)-value to a critical value from the Grubbs' distribution. Alternatively, one may use the **ratio of variances** between the full dataset and the dataset excluding the suspected outlier.

---

### 2. Two Outliers on Opposite Tails

- **Purpose**: To test whether both the minimum and maximum values in the sample are outliers.
- **Statistic**: Based on the ratio of the **range** to the **standard deviation**:

  \[
  G = \frac{\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)}{s}
  \]

This variant detects symmetric anomalies on both tails of the distribution.

---

### 3. Two Outliers on the Same Tail

- **Purpose**: To determine whether two extreme values on the **same tail** are outliers.
- **Statistic**: Based on the ratio of variances:

  \[
  G = \frac{\text{variance of full sample}}{\text{variance without two extreme values}}
  \]

A significant difference may indicate the presence of two influential outliers on one end of the distribution.
