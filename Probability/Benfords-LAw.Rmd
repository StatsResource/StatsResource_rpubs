## Power Laws

Many manmade and naturally occurring phenomena—such as city sizes, incomes, word frequencies, and earthquake magnitudes—follow a **power-law distribution**.  
In such distributions, small values are exceedingly common while large values are increasingly rare.

Examples of power-law-related laws:

- Bradford's Law  
- Benford's Law  
- Zipf's Distribution

## Benford's Law

Benford's Law, also known as the **First-Digit Law**, describes the expected distribution of leading digits in many naturally occurring datasets.

- Digit **1** appears as the leading digit about **30%** of the time.
- Higher digits appear less frequently: **9** appears first less than **5%** of the time.
- The law also extends to digits beyond the first, which approach a **uniform distribution**.

Originally observed by Simon Newcomb in 1881 and formalized by Frank Benford in 1938, the law holds particularly well for datasets spanning **multiple orders of magnitude**.

### Applications of Benford's Law

Benford’s Law is widely used in **fraud detection**, **forensic accounting**, and **audit analytics**. Because manipulated data often deviates from the expected digit frequency, accountants and investigators can flag anomalies in financial statements, tax returns, or expense reports. The law is also applied in scientific integrity reviews, election data validation, and even ecological data verification to detect errors or potential data tampering.

## Benford Distribution in R

```r
# Compute the Benford probability distribution for digits 1 through 9
library(VGAM)
dbenf(c(1:9))
```

```r
# Visualize the Benford distribution
barplot(dbenf(c(1:9)), 
        names.arg = 1:9,
        col = "steelblue",
        main = "Benford's First Digit Distribution",
        xlab = "Leading Digit", 
        ylab = "Probability")
```
