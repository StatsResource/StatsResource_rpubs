# Chi-Square Test of Association

The Chi-Square Test of Association is used to determine whether two categorical variables are statistically related in a contingency table.

---

## Understanding the Contingency Table

We begin with the following observed frequency table:

|            | Cat X | Cat Y | Cat Z | Total |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cat A**  | ?      | 60     | ?      | 200    |
| **Cat B**  | ?      | ?      | ?      | 400    |
| **Total**  | 150    | 180    | 270    | 600    |

We are interested in calculating the **expected frequency** for **Cell (1,1)** â€” the intersection of **Cat A** and **Cat X**.

---

## Calculating Expected Frequency

The expected frequency for a cell is calculated as:

\[
E_{(i,j)} = \frac{\text{Row Total}_i \times \text{Column Total}_j}{\text{Grand Total}}
\]

For **Cell (1,1)**:

- Row Total (Cat A): 200  
- Column Total (Cat X): 150  
- Grand Total: 600  

\[
E_{(1,1)} = \frac{200 \times 150}{600} = \frac{30,000}{600} = 50
\]

So, the expected value in Cell (1,1) is **50**.

## Completing the Table of Expected Frequencies

Now, use the same formula to compute all other expected values:

|            | Cat X | Cat Y | Cat Z | Total |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cat A**  | 50     | 60     | 90     | 200    |
| **Cat B**  | 100    | 120    | 180    | 400    |
| **Total**  | 150    | 180    | 270    | 600    |

---

## Critical Value and Decision Rule

To evaluate the statistical significance:

- Choose a **significance level** (\( \alpha \)), commonly 0.05  
- Determine **degrees of freedom (df)** using:  
  \[
  df = (r - 1)(c - 1)
  \]
  where \( r \) = number of rows, \( c \) = number of columns  

Compare the computed Chi-Square test statistic to the critical value from the Chi-Square distribution table. If the test statistic is **greater** than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis of independence.
