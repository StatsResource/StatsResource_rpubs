- The `wilcox.test` command  can be used to perform one- and two-sample Wilcoxon tests on data.
- The two sample procedure is also known as 'Mann-Whitney' test. 

### One Sample Test


```{r}
x <- c(1.83, 0.5, 1.62, 2.48, 1.68, 1.88, 1.55, 3.06, 1.3)
median(x)
```


```{r}
wilcox.test(x, mu = 1.6)
```



```{r}
wilcox.test(x, mu = 3, alternative = "greater")
```



### Paired sample test.
***Hollander & Wolfe (1973), 29f.***

Hamilton depression scale factor measurements in 9 patients with mixed anxiety and depression, taken at the first (x) and second (y) visit after initiation of a therapy (administration of a tranquilizer).

*Remark - location shift indicates a difference in medians.*


```{r}

x <- c(1.83, 0.5, 1.62, 2.48, 1.68, 1.88, 1.55, 3.06, 1.3)
y <- c(0.878, 0.647, 0.598, 2.05, 1.06, 1.29, 1.06, 3.14, 1.29)

wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater")
```


```{r}
wilcox.test(y - x, alternative = "less")  # The same.
```



```{r}

wilcox.test(y - x, alternative = "less", exact = FALSE, correct = FALSE)  # H&W large sample
```



### Two-sample test.
***Hollander & Wolfe (1973), 69f.***

Permeability constants of the human chorioamnion (a placental membrane) at term (x) and between 12 to 26 weeks gestational age (y).  The alternative of interest is greater permeability of the human chorioamnion for the term pregnancy.

Remark - location shift indicates a difference in medians


```{r}
x <- c(0.8, 0.83, 1.89, 1.04, 1.45, 1.38, 1.91, 1.64, 0.73, 1.46)
y <- c(1.15, 0.88, 0.9, 0.74, 1.21)
wilcox.test(x, y, alternative = "g")  # greater
```


```{r}
wilcox.test(x, y, alternative = "greater", exact = FALSE, correct = FALSE)  # H&W large sample
```


```{r}
# approximation

wilcox.test(rnorm(10), rnorm(10, 2), conf.int = TRUE)
```


### Formula interface.
The formula interface is only applicable for the 2-sample tests. 

```{r}

boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, horizontal = TRUE, col = c("lightpink", 
    "lightblue", "lightgreen", "white", "hotpink"))
```

```{r}

wilcox.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, subset = Month %in% c(5, 8))
```
