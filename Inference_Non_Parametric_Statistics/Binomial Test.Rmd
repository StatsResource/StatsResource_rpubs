### Binomial test
 
A binomial test compares the number of successes observed in a given number of trials with a hypothesised probability of success.
The test has the null hypothesis that the real probability of success is equal to some value denoted p, and the alternative hypothesis that it is not equal to p. 
The test can also be performed with a one-sided alternative hypothesis that the real probability of success is either greater than p or that it is less than p.


```{r}
binom.test(x = 3, n = 4, p=.5, alternative="greater")
```

-------------------------------------------------

### Example
Under (the assumption of) simple Mendelian inheritance, a cross between plants of two particular genotypes produces progeny 1/4 of which are "dwarf" and 3/4 of which are "giant", respectively.

In an experiment to determine if this assumption is reasonable, a cross results in progeny having 243 dwarf and 682 giant plants.
If "giant" is taken as success, the null hypothesis is that p = 3/4 and the alternative that p != 3/4.
* ***Conover (1971), p. 97f.***


```{r}
binom.test(c(682, 243), p = 3/4)
```
```{r}
binom.test(682, 682 + 243, p = 3/4)   # The same.
```

Conclusion: Data are in agreement with the null hypothesis.
