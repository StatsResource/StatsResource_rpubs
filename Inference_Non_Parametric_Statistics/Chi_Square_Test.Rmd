# Chi-Squared Test and Probability – A Step-by-Step Guide

## What is a Chi-Squared Test?

A **chi-squared ($\chi^2$) test** is a statistical method used to analyze tabular data with frequencies or counts. It helps determine whether two qualitative variables are related or independent. Common applications include examining:

- Hair colour vs. eye colour  
- Gender vs. handedness  
- Social status vs. crime rates

## Example Dataset: Handedness by Gender

Here’s a contingency table showing gender and handedness:

|               | Right-Handed | Left-Handed | Total |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Male**      | 43           | 9           | 52    |
| **Female**    | 44           | 4           | 48    |
| **Total**     | 87           | 13          | 100   |

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$):** Gender and handedness are independent  
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):** There is a relationship between gender and handedness

## Conducting the Chi-Squared Test

### Step 1: State the Hypotheses

- $H_0$: The variables are independent  
- $H_1$: The variables are dependent  

### Step 2: Compute the Test Statistic

Use this formula for each cell:

\[
\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\]

Where:

- $O_{ij}$ = Observed frequency  
- $E_{ij}$ = Expected frequency if $H_0$ were true  

### Step 3: Calculate and Sum the Terms

\[
T = \frac{(20 - 15)^2}{15} + \frac{(10 - 15)^2}{15} + \cdots = 6.67
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the Critical Value

- Degrees of freedom: $(2-1)(3-1) = 2$  
- Critical value at 5% significance: **7.378**  

**Decision:**  
Since 6.67 < 7.378, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There's insufficient evidence of a relationship between gender and course choice.

## Probability Insights

### Student Distribution by Course and Gender

| Program        | Male | Female | Total |
|----------------|------|--------|-------|
| Maths          | 20   | 10     | 30    |
| Equine Studies | 10   | 20     | 30    |
| Chemistry      | 30   | 30     | 60    |
| **Total**      | 60   | 60     | 120   |

### Basic Probability

**Probability a student is in Equine Studies:**

\[
P(\text{Equine}) = \frac{30}{120} = 0.25
\]

### Conditional Probability

**Probability a student is in Equine Studies given they are female:**

\[
P(\text{Equine} | \text{Female}) = \frac{20/120}{60/120} = 0.33
\]

## Chi-Squared Test Formula (General)

\[
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
\]

Where:

- $X^2$ = Chi-squared statistic  
- $O_i$ = Observed frequency  
- $E_i$ = Expected frequency  
- $n$ = Number of categories

## Summary

The chi-squared test is a valuable tool in analyzing the independence between categorical variables and determining whether observed differences are statistically significant.
