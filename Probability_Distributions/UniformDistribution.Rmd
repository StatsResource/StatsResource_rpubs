## Uniform Distributions 

### Theory


#### Uniform distribution
A random variable is called a uniform random variable the interval (a,b) if its probability density function is given

\[f_X(x) = \begin{cases}  {1 \over b-a } \\ 0 \end{cases} \]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Worked Examples

<h5>Worked Examples</h5>

The weights to salads taken by customers at a self-service salad bare found to be uniformly distributed between 250g and 450g

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Write down the probability density function for this distribution.
b. Find the probability that a customer will take a salad weighing more than 400g.
c. Find the probability that a customer will take a salad weighing between 320g and 400g.
d. What are the mean and standard deviations of the salad weights taken by customers.

### Distributional Formulas


#### Continuous Uniform distribution

The probability density function is given as

\[f(x) = {1 \over b-a} \mbox{ for } a \le x \le b\]

For any value "c" between the minimum value a and the maximum value b

\[P(X \ geq c) = {b-c \over b-a}\]

here b is the upper bound while c is the lower bound


\[P(X \ leq c) = {c-a \over b-a}\]

here c is the upper bound while a is the lower bound




Probability of an outcome being between lower bound L and upper bound U
\[P( L \leq X \leq U)  =  { U - L \over  b â€“ a }\]



<h5>Reminder</h5>


* [L] lower bound of an interval
* [U] upper bound of an interval

* " $\leq$" is less than or equal to

* " $\geq$" is greater than or equal to

* $L \leq X \leq U$ simply states that X is between L and U inclusively.

("inclusively" mean that X could be exactly L or U also, although the probability of this is extremely low)
