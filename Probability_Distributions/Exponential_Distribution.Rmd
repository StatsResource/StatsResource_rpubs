# Exponential Distribution

The **Exponential Distribution** is used to model the time between events in a process that occurs **continuously and independently** at a constant average rate. It is ideal for answering questions like:

- How long until the next earthquake occurs?
- What is the waiting time for the next customer to arrive?
- How long will a machine operate before it breaks down?

---

## Definition

The time \( X \) until the next event follows an exponential distribution if the **probability of occurrence in a short interval is proportional to the length of the interval**.

A random variable \( X \) has an exponential distribution with **rate parameter** \( \lambda > 0 \), written:
\[
X \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)
\]

---

## Probability Functions

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

\[
f(x; \lambda) =
\begin{cases}
\lambda e^{-\lambda x}, & x \ge 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

- \( \lambda \) is the **rate** (e.g. arrivals per hour)
- \( \mu = \frac{1}{\lambda} \) is the **mean waiting time**

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

\[
F(x; \lambda) =
\begin{cases}
1 - e^{-\lambda x}, & x \ge 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

---

## Key Properties

- **Mean (expected value):**  
  \[
  E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
  \]

- **Variance:**  
  \[
  V[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
  \]

- **Memoryless Property:**  
  \[
  P(X > s + t \mid X > s) = P(X > t)
  \]  
  The exponential is the *only* continuous distribution with this property.

## Lifetimes and Reliability

Exponential distributions are widely used to model **lifespans** of components, times between events, and reliability:

- Time to failure of electronics
- Duration between bus arrivals
- Period between incoming phone calls

Let \( \mu = 5 \). Then the probability that a device lasts more than 6 years is:
\[
P(X \ge 6) = e^{-6 / 5} \approx 0.3012
\]

---

## Example Calculations

Suppose \( \mu = 5 \) years:

- \( P(X \ge 6) = e^{-6/5} = 0.3012 \)
- \( P(X \le 4) = 1 - e^{-4/5} = 0.5507 \)
- \( P(5 \le X \le 6) = e^{-5/5} - e^{-6/5} = 0.3679 - 0.3012 = 0.0667 \)

## Review Questions

**Q1.** A call center receives 5 calls per hour.

- What is the expected time between calls?
- What is the probability that the next call comes within 6 minutes?

---

**Q2.** The time between bank customers is exponentially distributed with \( \lambda = 0.25 \).

- Find the mean wait time.
- What is the probability the next arrival takes more than 5 minutes?
- What is the probability it takes less than 2 minutes?

---

**Q3.** A gas station receives 3 customers/hour.

- What is the expected wait time?
- Compute \( E(T) \) and \( \text{Var}(T) \)
- What's the chance the next customer arrives in 15 minutes?
- What's the probability *no customer* arrives in the next 30 minutes?
