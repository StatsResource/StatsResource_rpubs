# The Hypergeometric Distribution: A Tutorial

## Introduction

The **hypergeometric distribution** models the probability of drawing a specific number of successes from a finite population *without replacement*. It's commonly used in scenarios such as quality control, lotteries, and sampling without replacement in general.

---

## When to Use the Hypergeometric Distribution

Use this distribution when the following conditions are met:

- The population has two distinct types (e.g. pass/fail, male/female).
- Sampling is done *without replacement*, so the probability of success changes after each draw.
- You're interested in the number of successes in a fixed number of draws.

This contrasts with the binomial distribution, which assumes replacement or an infinite population (meaning the success probability stays constant).

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

If a random variable \( X \) follows a hypergeometric distribution, its probability mass function is:

\[
P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
\]

Where:
- \( N \): Total population size
- \( K \): Number of success states in the population
- \( n \): Number of items drawn from the population
- \( k \): Number of observed successes
- \( \binom{a}{b} \): Binomial coefficient, or “a choose b”

---

## Why Not Use the Bernoulli/Binomial Model?

When sampling is without replacement:
- Each draw slightly changes the composition of the population.
- Thus, probabilities shift dynamically, and the **Bernoulli process no longer applies**.

The hypergeometric distribution captures this dynamic change accurately.

---

## Group-Based Perspective

In problems involving distinct subgroups, the probability of a particular group outcome can be modeled as:

\[
P = \frac{ \binom{n_1}{k_1} \binom{n_2}{k_2} }{ \binom{n_T}{k_T} }
\]

Where:
- \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \): Sizes of group 1 and group 2
- \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \): Number selected from each group
- \( n_T = n_1 + n_2 \)
- \( k_T = k_1 + k_2 \)

This is useful when thinking of drawing from multiple categories or compartments.

---

## Example

**Problem**: Suppose we want to select a group of 8 people from a population of 18, which includes 10 males and 8 females.  
**Question**: What is the probability that the selected group contains exactly 5 females?

Let:
- Total population \( N = 18 \)
- Number of successes (females) \( K = 8 \)
- Sample size \( n = 8 \)
- Number of desired successes \( k = 5 \)

Apply the PMF:

\[
P(X = 5) = \frac{\binom{8}{5} \binom{10}{3}}{\binom{18}{8}}
\]

This gives the probability of selecting exactly 5 females (and therefore 3 males) in the sample.

---

## Summary

The hypergeometric distribution is ideal when dealing with:
- Small populations
- No replacement
- A finite number of success states

Always be sure to distinguish it from the binomial distribution, and pay attention to the population composition as it shifts during sampling.
