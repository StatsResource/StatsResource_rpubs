# Understanding the Geometric Distribution

The **geometric distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of *Bernoulli trials* required to achieve the first success. It's like flipping a coin or rolling a die repeatedly until a specific outcome occurs.

## When to Use It

Use a geometric distribution when:
- Each trial is independent.
- There are only two outcomes: success or failure.
- The probability of success, denoted by \( p \), remains constant.
- You're interested in either:
  - The trial number of the **first success**, or
  - The number of **failures** before the first success.

## Two Types of Geometric Distributions

There are two closely related versions:

| Type | Interpretation | Support | Probability Mass Function |
|------|----------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Type I (Shifted) | Number of trials until first success | \( \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \) | \( P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k-1} p \) |
| Type II | Number of failures before first success | \( \{0, 1, 2, \dots\} \) | \( P(Y = k) = (1 - p)^k p \) |

Note: The term “geometric distribution” can refer to either one, so always clarify which form you're using.

## Example

Suppose you're rolling a fair six-sided die until you get your first "1":
- Success probability: \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- The number of rolls follows a geometric distribution.

---

## Key Properties

The distributions differ in their expected values and variances:

| Type | Mean | Variance |
|------|------|----------|
| Trials until success | \( \frac{1}{p} \) | \( \frac{1 - p}{p^2} \) |
| Failures before success | \( \frac{1 - p}{p} \) | \( \frac{1 - p}{p^2} \) |

---

## Recursive Cumulants (Advanced)

Let \( \mu = \frac{1 - p}{p} \) be the mean of the failures-before-success distribution. The cumulants \( \kappa_n \) satisfy the recursive relation:

\[
\kappa_{n+1} = \mu(\mu + 1) \frac{d\kappa_n}{d\mu}
\]

This relates each cumulant to its predecessor using the mean.

---

## Quick Summary

- Geometric distributions model the number of trials or failures before the first success.
- The two forms look similar but describe different things—always specify which you're using.
- These distributions are memoryless: the probability of success remains unchanged no matter how many failures have occurred.
